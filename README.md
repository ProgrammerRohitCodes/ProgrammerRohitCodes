# 👋 Hey, I'm Rohit Nath

**Aspiring AI/ML Engineer | Python Developer | Exploring Agentic AI**

I enjoy working with data and building practical AI systems — turning raw, unstructured information into something meaningful using machine learning and NLP.  
Most of my time goes into experimenting with models, cleaning data, and understanding how real-world AI systems behave beyond theory.
